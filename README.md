How does your script work? (if not addressed in comments in source)

My source code is not complete, this is something that I was knew how to do when I attended WDI however, I am a bit rusty and cannot recall how to tie the source code all together.  I believe that I need to link the API and initiate the code, then use the Update function to change the original information in the API to the updated information.  I am unsure if I need to POST after the update, but I don't believe so. 

What documentation, websites, etc did you consult in doing this assignment?

I used google to recall how to rewrite the "meat" of the code.  

What third-party libraries or other tools does the script use? How did you choose each library you used?

I did not use any third party librabries as I did not make it to that point in the code.

How long did you spend on this exercise? If you had unlimited additional time to spend on this, how would you spend it and how would you prioritize each item?

Unfortunately, due to my current employment situtation, I was only able to take the one day off to both study and prepare this exercise.  If I had additional time, I would use it to dive deeper into the REST API interworkings and "re-learn" how to complete this assignment.

If you were to critique your code, what would you have to say about it?

The code needs to be completed, after which I would check it for efficiency to try to complete this assignment in as few lines as possible.
